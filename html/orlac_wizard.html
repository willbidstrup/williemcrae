        <h1>Willie McRae... as "Orlac Wizard"</h1>

<p>
  You are Orlac Wizard, born a thousand years from now, mightiest of all human wizards. <br>

  Your hands can create magical potions of great complexity that grant wondrous effects to the imbiber.<br>

  You bear glyphs of power on each arm that increase your ability to wield magic of all kinds.<br>

  You were born with these glyphs, and are unsure of their true meaning.<br>

  For centuries you have been working on your final magic potion, one that will allow you to travel through time. <br>

  Today is the day that your dreams have become reality, and your most ambitious potion now rests in your hands.<br>

  You stand atop a great mountain in front of your home, the seven spired Orlac Tower. <br>

  Your silhouette is menacing and powerful against the bright future moon.<br>

   The night is quiet…none dare approach you. <br>

  Before you is a portal through time that you created many years ago. <br>

  So far it has only been a source of frustration and rage. <br>

  At last you are able to drink your potion and step into the portal, ready to unlock the secrets of the Universe.<br>

  Your adventure begins now…
