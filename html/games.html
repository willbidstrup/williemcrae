          <h2> Inferno </h2>

          <p> We are playing the <a href="https://acheronstore.com/inferno/">Inferno</a> campaign, using a modified version of the 5th Edition Dungeons & Dragons rules.<br>
            You have twelve sessions to escpape from Hell. </p>

            <h3>Session 1</h3>
            <strong>The Cast:</strong>
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Lucrazia</strong>, atoning for the sin of "Theft", taking the form of <strong>The Serpent</strong>.</li>
              <li><strong>Andre</strong>, atoning for the sin of "Heresy", taking the form of <strong>The Heresiarch</strong>.</li>
              <li><strong>Alessia</strong>, atoning for the sin of "Violence Against Oneself", taking the form of <strong>The Jester</strong>.</li>
              <li><strong>Leonardo</strong>, atoning for the sin of "Violence Against God", taking the form of <strong>The Saint</strong>.</li>
              <li><strong>Brother William Of The Abyss</strong>, a spirit of unknown origins, acting as <strong>The Guide</strong>.</li>
            </ul>

            <p> You awakened in <strong> The Dark Forest</strong>, and did battle with <strong>The First Keepers Of Hell</strong>.
              <br>
              <strong>Lucrazia</strong> attempted to deceive <strong>The Lion</strong> by playing dead, and she was helped to make her performance very convicing.
              <br>
              One by one, you were defeated by the beasts, ripped and voided, until you woke again on the shore of a glowing pool, where you met <strong> The Guide </strong>.
              <br>
              He led you through <strong>The Eternal Gate</strong> into a realm of endless grey, where the <strong>Indifferent Damned</strong> receive their punishment for failing to choose sides in the Divine War.
              <br>
              <strong>Andre</strong> met <strong>Ren√© The Musician</strong>.
              <br>
              <strong>Lucrazia</strong> met <strong>Marguerite The Weaver</strong>.
              <br>
              You all met <strong>Malaphar The Cruel</strong> and made a bargain with him to behead an <strong>Indifferent Angel</strong> by the name of <strong>Sariel</strong> in exchange for passage across the <strong>Acheronte</strong>.
                <br>
              You followed through on your bargain, and the spear strikes of <strong>Leonardo</strong> and spellcasting from <strong> Alessia </strong> were decisive in the battle.

              <h3>Session 2</h3>
              <strong>The Cast:</strong>
              <br>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Lucrazia</strong>, atoning for the sin of "Theft", taking the form of <strong>The Serpent</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Leonardo</strong>, atoning for the sin of "Violence Against God", taking the form of <strong>The Saint</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Borgas</strong>, atoning for the sin of "Wrath", taking the form of <strong>The Beast</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Giancamo</strong>, atoning for the sin of "Hypocrisy", taking the form of <strong>The Vicar</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Brother William Of The Abyss</strong>, a <strong>Noble Spirit</strong>.</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>
                You presented the severed head of <strong>Sariel The Indifferent Angel</strong> to <strong>Malaphar The Cruel</strong>, and thus gained passage on the ferry across <strong>The Acheronte</strong>.
                <br>
                You were beset by hordes of <strong>Indifferent Damned</strong>, yet you prevailed and stopped the <strong>Torch Of Divine Flame</strong> from being lost forever.
                <br>
                With the insults of <strong>Caronte</strong> still ringing in your ears, you stepped foot on the rocky and ashen land of <strong>Limbo</strong>, also known as <strong>The First Circle Of Hell</strong>. This was a barren and haunting landscape, filled with mazes and stones depicting blasphemous scenes of old pagan gods.
                <br>
                You navigated the obelisks and made your way towards <strong>The Castle Of The Noble Spirits</strong>. You did battle with the foul devil <strong>Mistral The Devourer</strong>, and rescued the soul of the boy <strong>Icaro</strong>, exchanging Hope so you might baptize him in the crystal clear waters surrounding the castle.
                <br>
                You each made a deal with a <strong>Noble Spirit</strong> in exchange for one of their golden ribs, which have been used to create a powerful <strong>Lantern Of The Divine Flame</strong>. This will help you as you continue your quest...
