          <h2> Inferno </h2>

          <p> We are playing the <a href="https://acheronstore.com/inferno/">Inferno</a> campaign, using a modified version of the 5th Edition Dungeons & Dragons rules.<br>
            You have twelve sessions to escpape from Hell. </p>

            <h3>Session 1</h3>
            <strong>The Cast:</strong>
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Lucrazia</strong>, atoning for the sin of "Theft", taking the form of <strong>The Serpent</strong>.</li>
              <li><strong>Andre</strong>, atoning for the sin of "Heresy", taking the form of <strong>The Heresiarch</strong>.</li>
              <li><strong>Alessia</strong>, atoning for the sin of "Violence Against Oneself", taking the form of <strong>The Jester</strong>.</li>
              <li><strong>Leonardo</strong>, atoning for the sin of "Violence Against God", taking the form of <strong>The Saint</strong>.</li>
              <li><strong>Brother William Of The Abyss</strong>, a spirit of unknown origins, acting as <strong>The Guide</strong>.</li>
            </ul>

            <p> You awakened in <strong> The Dark Forest</strong>, and did battle with <strong>The First Keepers Of Hell</strong>.
              <br>
              <strong>Lucrazia</strong> attempted to deceive <strong>The Lion</strong> by playing dead, and she was helped to make her performance very convicing.
              <br>
              One by one, you were defeated by the beasts, ripped and voided, until you woke again on the shore of a glowing pool, where you met <strong> The Guide </strong>.
              <br>
              He led you through <strong>The Eternal Gate</strong> into a realm of endless grey, where the <strong>Indifferent Damned</strong> receive their punishment for failing to choose sides in the Divine War.
              <br>
              <strong>Andre</strong> met <strong>Ren√© The Musician</strong>.
              <br>
              <strong>Lucrazia</strong> met <strong>Marguerite The Weaver</strong>.
              <br>
              You all met <strong>Malaphar The Cruel</strong> and made a bargain with him to behead an <strong>Indifferent Angel</strong> by the name of <strong>Sariel</strong> in exchange for passage across the <strong>Acheronte</strong>.
                <br>
              You followed through on your bargain, and the spear strikes of <strong>Leonardo</strong> and spellcasting from <strong> Alessia </strong> were decisive in the battle.
