            <h3>Session III</h3>
            <strong>The Cast:</strong>
              <br>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Lucrazia</strong>, atoning for the sin of "Theft", taking the form of The Serpent.</li>
                <li><strong>Leonardo</strong>, atoning for the sin of "Violence Against God", taking the form of The Saint.</li>
                <li><strong>Borgas</strong>, atoning for the sin of "Wrath", taking the form of The Beast.</li>
                <li><strong>Giancamo</strong>, atoning for the sin of "Hypocrisy", taking the form of The Vicar.</li>
                <li><strong>Alessia</strong>, atoning for the sin of "Violence Against Oneself", taking the form of The Jester.</li>
                <li><strong>Brother William Of The Abyss</strong>, a Noble Spirit.</li>
              </ul>

                <p>
                  You left the <strong>Castle Of The Noble Spirits</strong> and set forth through <strong>Limbo</strong>.
                  <br>
                  You did battle with <strong>Ettore, Champion Of The False Gods</strong>. He coveted your <strong>Lantern Of The Divine Flame</strong> and sought to impale you upon his spear.
                  <br>
                  <strong>Lucrazia</strong> managed to lift his golden helm from his head before he fell to your strikes and spells.
                  <br>
                  Many Devils watched and placed bets during the fight, and one was convinced to let you skip the line of Damned to visit <strong>Minosse, Third Keeper Of Hell</strong>.
                  <br>
                  <strong>Brother William</strong> was flung to whence he came.
                  <br>
                  <strong>Alessia</strong> confounded and upturned all paradigms by successfully moving <strong>Minosse</strong> to tears with her performance, and thus you gained entry into the second layer of Hell...<strong>The Hurricane</strong>.
                  <br>
                  Here you met the lovers, <strong>Isabella de' Conti</strong> and <strong>Étienne de Montferrat</strong>. They beseeched you to help them become eternally bound.
                  <br>
                  The devil <strong>Sferzanvento</strong> approached and bade you follow him to the lair of his former associate, the powerful tempestarii, <strong>Calcabrina</strong>.
                  <br>
                  Now you do battle on a pillar of stone as hurricane winds whip around you and primordial birds screech overhead. Will you retain the <strong>Hope</strong> to continue your journey?
                </p>


                <h3>Session II</h3>
                <strong>The Cast:</strong>
                <br>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Lucrazia</strong>, atoning for the sin of "Theft", taking the form of <strong>The Serpent</strong>.</li>
                  <li><strong>Leonardo</strong>, atoning for the sin of "Violence Against God", taking the form of <strong>The Saint</strong>.</li>
                  <li><strong>Borgas</strong>, atoning for the sin of "Wrath", taking the form of <strong>The Beast</strong>.</li>
                  <li><strong>Giancamo</strong>, atoning for the sin of "Hypocrisy", taking the form of <strong>The Vicar</strong>.</li>
                  <li><strong>Brother William Of The Abyss</strong>, a <strong>Noble Spirit</strong>.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>
                  You presented the severed head of <strong>Sariel The Indifferent Angel</strong> to <strong>Malaphar The Cruel</strong>, and thus gained passage on the ferry across <strong>The Acheronte</strong>.
                  <br>
                  You were beset by hordes of <strong>Indifferent Damned</strong>, yet you prevailed and stopped the <strong>Torch Of Divine Flame</strong> from being lost forever.
                  <br>
                  With the insults of <strong>Caronte</strong> still ringing in your ears, you stepped foot on the rocky and ashen land of <strong>Limbo</strong>, also known as <strong>The First Circle Of Hell</strong>. This was a barren and haunting landscape, filled with mazes and stones depicting blasphemous scenes of old pagan gods.
                  <br>
                  You navigated the obelisks and made your way towards <strong>The Castle Of The Noble Spirits</strong>. You did battle with the foul devil <strong>Mistral The Devourer</strong>, and rescued the soul of the boy <strong>Icaro</strong>, exchanging Hope so you might baptize him in the crystal clear waters surrounding the castle.
                  <br>
                  You each made a deal with a <strong>Noble Spirit</strong> in exchange for one of their golden ribs, which have been used to create a powerful <strong>Lantern Of The Divine Flame</strong>. This will help you as you continue your quest...
                </p>
                
              

            <h3>Session I</h3>
            <strong>The Cast:</strong>
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Lucrazia</strong>, atoning for the sin of "Theft", taking the form of <strong>The Serpent</strong>.</li>
              <li><strong>Andre</strong>, atoning for the sin of "Heresy", taking the form of <strong>The Heresiarch</strong>.</li>
              <li><strong>Alessia</strong>, atoning for the sin of "Violence Against Oneself", taking the form of <strong>The Jester</strong>.</li>
              <li><strong>Leonardo</strong>, atoning for the sin of "Violence Against God", taking the form of <strong>The Saint</strong>.</li>
              <li><strong>Brother William Of The Abyss</strong>, a spirit of unknown origins, acting as <strong>The Guide</strong>.</li>
            </ul>

            <p> You awakened in <strong> The Dark Forest</strong>, and did battle with <strong>The First Keepers Of Hell</strong>.
              <br>
              <strong>Lucrazia</strong> attempted to deceive <strong>The Lion</strong> by playing dead, and she was helped to make her performance very convicing.
              <br>
              One by one, you were defeated by the beasts, ripped and voided, until you woke again on the shore of a glowing pool, where you met <strong> The Guide </strong>.
              <br>
              He led you through <strong>The Eternal Gate</strong> into a realm of endless grey, where the <strong>Indifferent Damned</strong> receive their punishment for failing to choose sides in the Divine War.
              <br>
              <strong>Andre</strong> met <strong>René The Musician</strong>.
              <br>
              <strong>Lucrazia</strong> met <strong>Marguerite The Weaver</strong>.
              <br>
              You all met <strong>Malaphar The Cruel</strong> and made a bargain with him to behead an <strong>Indifferent Angel</strong> by the name of <strong>Sariel</strong> in exchange for passage across the <strong>Acheronte</strong>.
                <br>
              You followed through on your bargain, and the spear strikes of <strong>Leonardo</strong> and spellcasting from <strong> Alessia </strong> were decisive in the battle.
