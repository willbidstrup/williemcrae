        <h1>Willie McRae... as "Bill" in DSV</h1>

<p>
DSV is a band who played between 1996 and 2000.
<br>
<br>
Bass: Marty <br>
Guitar: Jamie <br>
Drums: Bill <br>
<br>
Sometimes, when my arm was broken, I sang lead vox while my brother Rob slammed the drums. <br>
We put out nine songs, recorded by the late, great, John Spurr.

<br>
Huge riff in this one. <br>
Big group vox. <br>
What's not to like? <br>
A crowd favourite.
<br>
<br>
<i>I love you baby, <br>
  I love you beer,<br>
  I wanna get closer,<br>
  To that carton of beer. <br>
  I love you baby, <br>
  I love your gear,<br>
  You look much better,<br>
  When I've drunk beer. <br>
  I love you baby, <br>
  I love your beard, <br>
  Buy us a bourbon, <br>
  And a carton of beer.

<br>
I really like the bass sound at the start of this one. <br>
I remember Marty playing it in our jamming room, and Jamie bringing in the riff. <br>
And a big guitar solo. <br>
The lyrics are all Marty on this one I think. <br>
Good stuff. <br>
A bit Dylan-esque. <br>
<br>
<br>
<i>Steal the thief, <br>
  Fuck the whore,<br>
  Burn the pyro,<br>
  Piss on the incontinent, <br>
  Eat the fat, <br>
  Rape the rapist,<br>
  Race the racist,<br>
  Throw up on the bulemic, <br>
  Stretch the short, <br>
  Blacken the white, <br>
  Flash the flasher, <br>
  Stiffen the floppy, <br>
  Sweeten the sour, <br>
  Cure the doctor, <br>
  Hump the whale, <br>
  Defecate on the constipated, <br>
  Drown the fish. Drown the fish.

<br>
This is one of the first original songs I remember us writing. <br>
The first of a few with strong lyrical themes about the government at the time. <br>
This one features Marty on lead vox as well as bass.
<br>
<br>
<i>So it's time to go to uni, <br>
  And get a degree,<br>
  Cause we don't want to be,<br>
  Shit-kickers for the rest of our lives, <br>
  But the Howard government, <br>
  Is going to change all of these things,<br>
  Gonna make us pay upfront fees,<br>
  The fucking cock-sucking bloddy wanker. <br>
  Fucking wanker. <br>
  He's a fucking wanker. <br>
  What a wanker.

<br>
This one moves from E to A sharp. <br>
I think I was channeling a bit of Zach De La Rocha for the vocal delivery.
<br>
<br>
<i>I got a notion it's about to blow,<br>
  Fuck the government,<br>
  And let it show,<br>
  Filthy liberal pigs, they are in power, <br>
  And it's the poor that they will devour. <br>
  I got a notion and it ain't gonna go, <br>
  I know they're lying, hell that ain't much to know, <br>
  Funding for aged health care is being cut, <br>
  But do the politicians really give a fuck? <br>
  I've got a notion, coming right now. <br>
  (And when it's hot, wear suntan lotion)

<br>
This is the first song I can remember writing lyrics to, where I didn't also write the music. <br> I was not a confident vocalist, but I gave it my best shot. <br>
I asked for a prompt, what's the name of this track? <br>
The answer was "Icy Pole". <br>
This song was a crowd favourite at gigs. <br> I sang while playing drums. <br> I love the distorted Big Muff bass sound and the guitar solo.
<br>
<br>
<i>I went to the shop and I bought an icy pole, <br>
  Because you said, that I was not hard,<br>
  And so now your orifice contains an icy block,<br>
  Serves you right for paying out my cock. <br>
  Icy pole, icy pole, icy pole. <br>
  So now you've got an icy pole stuck in you,<br>
  I know it's not a nice thing for me to do,<br>
  But I'm gonna put an icy pole down my own pants,<br>
  Yes I'm gonna stick an icy pole up my arse. <br>

<br>
This one features Marty on vocals. <br>
I love the attitude of this track. <br>
Another strong Big Muff bassline. <br>
Another cool guitar solo, this time with some delicious wah-wah. <br>
A good amount of snare-on-one from me.
<br>
<br>
<i>Sheepish people, they're fucked, fucked in the head, <br>
  They don't use their brains, hang in gangs, wear Nike shit,<br>
  Take part in fads, transmit crabs, eat McDonalds or Hungry Jacks,<br>
  Help those who want more power, like neo-nazi flowers. <br>
  Hitler. <br>

<br>
This one has us all on vocals.
<br>
<br>
<i>(I know something that smells like fish),<br>
  No matter what they say, <br>
  Despite all the spurious allegations, <br>
  We all like to drink, <br>
  We all like to smoke, <br>
  And we all live to shower. <br>
  Blunt. Blunt. Blunt. Blunt. <br>
  (I know something that smells like fish),<br>
  No matter what you do, <br>
  I don't care what you say, <br>
  We're gonna break into your heart, <br>
  Steal all of your love juices, <br>
  And take a damn good look at your... <br>
  Blunt. Blunt. Blunt. Blunt. <br>
  (You can't say that.) <br>

The guitar solo in this one reminds me of Primus.
<br>
<br>
<i>Cordial,<br>
  Red,<br>
  Hyper,<br>
  Dick/shit head.

<br>
This was one of the last ones we wrote, I think. <br>
I did write a rap which I performed live, but it has been lost to the sands of time.
