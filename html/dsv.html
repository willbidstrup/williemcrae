This is the first song I can remember writing lyrics to, where I didn't also write the music. <br> I was not a confident vocalist, but I gave it my best shot. <br>
I asked for a prompt, what's the name of this track? <br>
The answer was "Icy Pole". <br>
This song was a crowd favourite at gigs. <br> I sang while playing drums. <br> I love the distorted Big Muff bass sound and the guitar solo. <br> <br>
<i>I went to the shop and I bought an icy pole, <br>
  Because you said, that I was not hard,<br>
  And so now your orifice contains an icy block,<br>
  Serves you right for paying out my cock. <br>
  Icy pole, icy pole, icy pole. <br>
  So now you've got an icy pole stuck in you,<br>
  I know it's not a nice thing for me to do,<br>
  But I'm gonna put an icy pole down my own pants,<br>
  Yes I'm gonna stick an icy pole up my arse.
