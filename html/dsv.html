This is the first song I can remember writing lyrics to, where I didn't also write the music. <br> I was not a confident vocalist, but I gave it my best shot. <br>
I asked for a prompt, what's the name of this track? <br>
The answer was "Icy Pole". <br>
This song was a crowd favourite at gigs. <br> I sang while playing drums. <br> I love the distorted Big Muff bass sound and the guitar solo.
<br>
<br>
<i>I went to the shop and I bought an icy pole, <br>
  Because you said, that I was not hard,<br>
  And so now your orifice contains an icy block,<br>
  Serves you right for paying out my cock. <br>
  Icy pole, icy pole, icy pole. <br>
  So now you've got an icy pole stuck in you,<br>
  I know it's not a nice thing for me to do,<br>
  But I'm gonna put an icy pole down my own pants,<br>
  Yes I'm gonna stick an icy pole up my arse. <br>

This one features Marty on vocals. <br>
I love the attitude of this track. <br>
Another strong Big Muff bassline. <br>
Another cool guitar solo, this time with some delicious wah-wah. <br>
A good amount of snare-on-one from me.

<i>Sheepish people, they're fucked, fucked in the head, <br>
  They don't use their brains, hang in gangs, wear Nike shit,<br>
  Take part in fads, transmit crabs, eat McDonalds or Hungry Jacks,<br>
  Help those who want more power, like neo-nazi flowers. <br>

<i>(I know something that smells like fish),<br>
  No matter what they say, <br>
  Despite all the spurious allegations, <br>
  We all like to drink, <br>
  We all like to smoke, <br>
  And we all live to shower. <br>
  Cunt. Cunt. Cunt. Cunt. <br>
  (I know something that smells like fish),<br>
  No matter what you do, <br>
  I don't care what you say, <br>
  We're gonna break into your heart, <br>
  Steal all of your love juices, <br>
  And take a damn good look at your... <br>
  Cunt. Cunt. Cunt. Cunt. <br>
  (You can't say that.) <br>
