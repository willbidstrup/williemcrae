    <p>I wrote this somewhere around 2010 while I was living in Brisbane. <br>
        Eddie Vendetta is playing the bass. <br>
        I programmed the drums (using Fruity Loops, I think) and laid down the voices and guitars in our house in Yeerongpilly. <br>
        I was probably thinking a lot about The Phantom to begin with, and things take a kind of Cthulhu-ish turn at the end… <br>
        I play a rocked up version live sometimes.</p>
<p><em>
Ohhh oh na na naa<br><br>

Take my hand,<br>
And come with me,<br>
Your body is tight,<br>
And your eyes so pretty,<br>
But that won’t help you here,<br>
You’re in the lands of the mists and rain.<br><br>

You’ve gotta stay close to me,<br>
If you want to survive,<br>
Stick with me,<br>
If you want to stay alive.<br>
Cause we’re not in the city anymore,<br>
I think it’s time you learned about the Jungle Law.<br><br>

It’s dark and hot,<br>
And wet and sticky,<br>
You try to scream,<br>
But there really is no need,<br>
Cause I can help you here,<br>
Where the sunlight breaks through the canopy.<br><br>

You’ve gotta stay close to me,<br>
If you want to survive,<br>
Stick with me,<br>
If you want to stay alive.<br>
Cause we’re not in the city anymore,<br>
I think it’s time you learned about the Jungle Law.<br><br>

Ohhh oh na na naa<br><br>

(Spoken word)<br>
I just wanted some adventure<br>
It seemed like a good idea at the time<br>
But now…<br>
Oh god I’m so scared,<br>
It’s so unforgiving here,<br>
There’s no electricity,<br>
No mobile reception,<br>
I’m so lucky I found a nice guy to help me,<br>
It’s just that, now, I can’t find him,<br>
He’s gone,<br>
He said he’d be back,<br>
But I don’t know what to believe any more,<br>
I can hear…voices in the distance,<br>
It’s smoky, and it’s getting dark,<br>
What am I going to do?<br>
I don’t want to die here.<br>

    <p>This was written and released as “When I Get To Where I’m Going” but almost everyone who hears it thinks “Space Trucker” or “Moon Trucker” is a better title, so I’m changing it.<br>
        I was channeling ZZ Top with the synth bass sounds and lead guitar style.<br>
        I was channeling Nev Nichols with the lyrical approach.<br>
        There are some sound effects at the start, bridge, and outro I like, including CB radio and some didgeridoo to give it Australian flavour.<br>
        I used to drive around a lot listening to cassette tapes of truck driving music.<br>
        I thought the future truckers might want to keep tape decks in their futuristic rigs, so there they are.<br>
        </p>
        
        <p><em>
        I’ve been driving all night long,<br>
        The stars are bright,<br>
        And my tape deck is on.<br><br>
        
        So ride with me,<br>
        Come on little baby,<br>
        Ride with me,<br>
        Come on and get crazy<br>
        Let’s ride.<br><br>
        
        Ride with me <br>
        Come on little baby,<br>
        Ride with me,<br>
        Come on and get crazy,<br>
        I don’t know which way the wind is blowing’<br>
        But I’ll figure it out when I get to where I’m goin’<br><br>
        
        I’ve been a-rollin’ all night long,<br>
        Across the Milky Way,<br>
        Into the dark beyond.<br><br>
        
        So ride with me,<br>
        Come on little baby,<br>
        Ride with me,<br>
        Come on and get crazy<br>
        Let’s ride.<br><br>
        
        Ride with me <br>
        Come on little baby,<br>
        Ride with me,<br>
        Come on and get crazy,<br>
        I don’t know which way the wind is blowing’<br>

    <p>This is part of the Farmer Zombie Trilogy. <br>
        I recorded it using a mix of programmed and organic drums, SFX, bass and my axe. <br>
        Most parts are one take, which is my preference.<br>
        I think the bass is my favourite part, especially in the outro.<br>
    </p>
    <p><em>
        Flame and fire haunt me,<br>
        But my bones do not care,<br>
        For I have lived a thousand years down there,<br>
        In the pits of the damned I was sent for my crimes,<br>
        Now I pay the devil’s debt on the land.<br>
        <br>
        Hand remember the axe it would strike hard and true,<br>
        Through skin and bone making rivers of blood,<br>
        Now I walk on the fields until the end of the Earth,<br>
        As long as crude oil exists for my wheels.<br>
        <br>
        I return to my homeland from Hell I have come,<br>
        I care not to talk about times down below,<br>
        For I so much work to do with shovel and pick and hammer and with hoe,<br>
        It was long time ago that I worked on these lands now in this time of strife I return.<br>
        <br>
        Down, down, down I go…<br>
        Down, down, down I go…<br>
        Down, down, down I go…<br>
        Down, down, down I go…<br>
        <br>
        Spiralling towards fiery pain I pay for my crimes as I lie on burning hot coals,<br>
        Spiralling towards fiery pain I pay for my crimes as I lie on burning hot coals.<br>
        <br>
        Chains, chains, chains grip me…<br>
        Chains, chains, chains grip me…<br>
        <br>
        No end in sight I will do what is right please release me into the world above,<br>
        No end in sight I will do what is right please release me into the world above.<br>

    <p>I wrote this as a country song and turned it into a sort of rock song.<br>
        No bass. <br>
        I’ll fix that in a re-record sometime.<br>
    </p>
    <p><em>
        Sword in hand,<br>
        I think back to the days,<br>
        When I dreamed of fighting and dying for glory,<br>
        My father taught me,<br>
        The ways of battle,<br>
        Of the sword and the axe and the bow,<br>
        My father taught me the ways of honour.<br>
        <br>
        Now with ancient steel in my hand,<br>
        I stand guard over ancient land,<br>
        I’ll kill for what I know is right,<br>
        And my enemies will never get to see a new day’s light.<br>
        <br>
        My life I gave,<br>
        In service to thee,<br>
        From humble beginnings to great destiny,<br>
        Betrayal!<br>
        The memory lingers on,<br>
        And now I will fight,<br>
        With vengeance and fury,<br>
        Yes I will cut you down.<br>
        <br>
        Now with ancient steel in my hand,<br>
        I stand guard over ancient land,<br>
        I’ll kill for what I know is right,<br>

    <p>I wrote this in my late 20’s after a slew of misadventures left me in financial trouble.<br>
        Synth bass, in the spirit of ZZ Top.<br>
        Hand claps and a self-chorus of background vox. <br>
    </p>
    <p><em>
        Well I was living,<br>
        But now I’m dying,<br>
        I was laughing,<br>

        Well I was on top of the world,<br>
        But now I’ve gotta stop,<br>
        Before I top.<br>

        I’m poor, poor, poor, <br>

        But now I’m drowning,<br>
        I was smiling,<br>
        But now I’m frowning,<br>
        I never cared much about having money,<br>
        But now that I got none I can’t even get a honey.<br>
        <br>
        Cause I’m poor,<br>
        I’m poor, poor, poor, <br>
        Poor.<br>

        I used to get,<br>
        What I wanted to get,<br>
        But now I’m up to my normal ears in this normal debt,<br>
        So I’m watching everything I’m spending,<br>
        In a desperate attempt to stop lending.<br>

    <p>This was the first song I wrote and recorded in my home studio after finishing up with High Stakes in the mid 2000’s. <br>
        I was inspired by a trip to Gumeracha.<br>
        I took this to Popkomm in Germany around 2008.<br>
        I sometimes rock it up into kind of bluesy, Elvisy sort of thing.<br>
    </p>
    <p><em>
        Well I’m a Gumeracha Frog,<br>

        I’m gonn sing ‘em a song,<br>
        Make them wanna sit with me,<br>
        And spend all night long in the Gumeracha creek.<br>

    <p>This is also part of the Farmer Zombie Trilogy.<br>
        I was experimenting a lot with SFX.<br>
        I thought this song was good enough that the official release includes a radio edit.<br>
        The spooky keyboard is supplied by my good friend Tom Bettany, aka Sad Sad Tim and Nathanial Beard.<br>

        In life I was a good man,<br>
        I’d treat everybody well,<br>
        But years of lonely undeath,<br>
        Have turned me into a farmer zombie from Hell.<br>

        Goes slipping away,<br>
        I appear in the moonlight,<br>
        And I start bailing hay,<br>
        Just because I’m dead,<br>
        Don’t mean that I ain’t got bills to pay,<br>
        And my cows don’t give milk anymore,<br>

    <p>I wrote this one when I was feeling pretty good about life, or at least pretending to be.<br>
        Lots of inspiration from Billy Bragg.<br>
        It’s all electric guitar and voice.<br>
