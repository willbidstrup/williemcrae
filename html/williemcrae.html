    <p>I wrote this somewhere around 2010 while I was living in Brisbane. <br>
        Eddie Vendetta is playing the bass. <br>
        I programmed the drums (using Fruity Loops, I think) and laid down the voices and guitars in our house in Yeerongpilly. <br>
        I was probably thinking a lot about The Phantom to begin with, and things take a kind of Cthulhu-ish turn at the end… <br>
        I play a rocked up version live sometimes.</p>
<p><em>
Ohhh oh na na naa<br><br>

Take my hand,<br>
And come with me,<br>
Your body is tight,<br>
And your eyes so pretty,<br>
But that won’t help you here,<br>
You’re in the lands of the mists and rain.<br><br>

You’ve gotta stay close to me,<br>
If you want to survive,<br>
Stick with me,<br>
If you want to stay alive.<br>
Cause we’re not in the city anymore,<br>
I think it’s time you learned about the Jungle Law.<br><br>

It’s dark and hot,<br>
And wet and sticky,<br>
You try to scream,<br>
But there really is no need,<br>
Cause I can help you here,<br>
Where the sunlight breaks through the canopy.<br><br>

You’ve gotta stay close to me,<br>
If you want to survive,<br>
Stick with me,<br>
If you want to stay alive.<br>
Cause we’re not in the city anymore,<br>
I think it’s time you learned about the Jungle Law.<br><br>

Ohhh oh na na naa<br><br>

(Spoken word)<br>
I just wanted some adventure<br>
It seemed like a good idea at the time<br>
But now…<br>
Oh god I’m so scared,<br>
It’s so unforgiving here,<br>
There’s no electricity,<br>
No mobile reception,<br>
I’m so lucky I found a nice guy to help me,<br>
It’s just that, now, I can’t find him,<br>
He’s gone,<br>
He said he’d be back,<br>
But I don’t know what to believe any more,<br>
I can hear…voices in the distance,<br>
It’s smoky, and it’s getting dark,<br>
What am I going to do?<br>
I don’t want to die here.<br>

    <p>This was written and released as “When I Get To Where I’m Going” but almost everyone who hears it thinks “Space Trucker” or “Moon Trucker” is a better title, so I’m changing it.<br>
        I was channeling ZZ Top with the synth bass sounds and lead guitar style.<br>
        I was channeling Nev Nichols with the lyrical approach.<br>
        There are some sound effects at the start, bridge, and outro I like, including CB radio and some didgeridoo to give it Australian flavour.<br>
        I used to drive around a lot listening to cassette tapes of truck driving music.<br>
        I thought the future truckers might want to keep tape decks in their futuristic rigs, so there they are.<br>
        </p>
        
        <p><em>
        I’ve been driving all night long,<br>
        The stars are bright,<br>
        And my tape deck is on.<br><br>
        
        So ride with me,<br>
        Come on little baby,<br>
        Ride with me,<br>
        Come on and get crazy<br>
        Let’s ride.<br><br>
        
        Ride with me <br>
        Come on little baby,<br>
        Ride with me,<br>
        Come on and get crazy,<br>
        I don’t know which way the wind is blowing’<br>
        But I’ll figure it out when I get to where I’m goin’<br><br>
        
        I’ve been a-rollin’ all night long,<br>
        Across the Milky Way,<br>
        Into the dark beyond.<br><br>
        
        So ride with me,<br>
        Come on little baby,<br>
        Ride with me,<br>
        Come on and get crazy<br>
        Let’s ride.<br><br>
        
        Ride with me <br>
        Come on little baby,<br>
        Ride with me,<br>
        Come on and get crazy,<br>
        I don’t know which way the wind is blowing’<br>
        But I’ll figure it out when I get to where I’m goin’<br>
