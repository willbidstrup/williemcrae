    <h2 id="rake-to-the-face">Rake To The Face</h2>
    <p>Day One on the job<br>
    I place the rake carefully on the ground<br>
    Somewhere out in the open<br>
    So it can be easily found<br>
    By me<br>
    Or my boss<br>
    I am asked to retrieve a phillips-head screwdriver<br>
    Which I would be happy to do<br>
    If I knew what the hell it was<br>
    I ask the question and my boss mutters under his breath<br>
    Is he swearing at me?<br>
    Yes, but also at his boss<br>
    Who is my Dad's friend<br>
    That's why I'm here<br>
    Not because of my vast knowledge of screwdrivers<br>
    Back to the rake<br>
    My boss, call him Darren<br>
    Stands up from his crouch and spins quickly<br>
    His foot connects with the prongs of the rake<br>
    Which lies prongs up, of course<br>
    Why not?<br>
    The handle crashes into his face<br>
    I wonder<br>
    Will I get to see Day Two of this job?</p>



    <h2 id="goodbye">Goodbye</h2>
    <p>Speed up time to a cosmic scale <br>
    Flickering lights<br>
    Our first breath, then last<br>
    Even the longest lives<br>
    Finish too fast<br>
    So cherish this pause <br>
    This simple embrace <br>
    Goodbye for now<br>
    Or forever</p>

    <h2 id="la-passagiata">La Passagiata</h2>
    <p>Cobbled stones <br>
    Rustic doorways <br>
    Elegant graffiti <br>
    Caves in a cliff-face <br>
    Shadows on the wall <br>
    Golden sun yawns <br>
    Hands clasped<br>
    On our afternoon stroll</p>

    <h2 id="27-days-of-scramble">27 Days Of Scramble</h2>
    <p>New reflections on ancient topics<br>
    Butterflies locked in the tropics<br>
    Hammer strikes the piano<br>
    Blank rest gives space to the flow<br>
    Metal mice play to the beat inside a dark fort<br>
    Spirit goat fights to remember what he was taught <br>
    Lamentation<br><br>

    Drive to forget by taking up a quill<br>
    Stand on the mat everyday from sheer force of will <br>
    My prime just a concept now, a memory, a sense <br>
    In my home city receiving my comeuppance <br>
    Opportunity, challenge, risk, reward, defeat<br>
    Chilli pepper - cleanse my pain with heat!</p>

    <h2 id="the-loch-ness-monster">The Loch Ness Monster</h2>
    <p>Once upon a time<br>
    I sipped from the loch<br>
    I was young and bold <br>
    But it made me feel sick<br><br>

    I thought you would laugh <br>
    At my interesting trick<br>
    But you thought it was dumb <br>
    And this I was told<br><br>

    At night as I slept<br>
    I dreamed of old Nessy <br>
    She’d entered my blood <br>
    From that fateful sip<br><br>

    A messy affair<br>
    No peace on the land<br>
    And now I have flippers <br>
    Where I used to have hands</p>

    <h2 id="tropical-island-world">Tropical Island World</h2>
    <p>A wondrous location <br>
    For a vacation<br>
    Slides and balloons <br>
    Wurst and tunes <br>
    Inside and out<br>
    The families shout<br>
    Hot water please<br>
    To defeat the cold breeze</p>

    <h2 id="the-butterfly-cage-with-two-ears">The Butterfly Cage With Two Ears</h2>
    <p>My thoughts<br>
    Start out crawling around<br>
    Easily ignored<br>
    Stepped on<br>
    Misunderstood<br>
    Celebrated when they take flight <br>
    Showing off their colours <br>
    Flitting around in groups <br>
    Emergent dancing<br>
    Temporary flamboyance<br>
    Making hurricanes <br>
    Somewhere...someday</p>

    <h2 id="why-must-i-learn-to-drive-again">Why Must I Learn To Drive Again?</h2>
    <p>Because I had it easy <br>
    Walked everywhere <br>
    No need to care<br>
    For a car or even a bike <br>
    Catch a train for a hike <br>
    Spend the day in green fields <br>
    Then back home<br>
    For a meal<br><br>

    Letters in the mail <br>
    So boring<br>
    Printed and sent <br>
    For my ignoring<br><br>

    Until I realised<br>
    That I must return<br>
    To the wide streets of my youth <br>
    Whereupon driving I’d learned <br>
    Back in those days<br>
    When the steering wheel feel <br>
    Held the promise of freedom <br>
    And endless appeal</p>

    <h2 id="time-to-fight">Time To Fight</h2>
    <p>We shall muster<br>
    At the appointed time <br>
    With sharpened steel <br>
    And polished helmets<br><br>

    What and how matters more<br>
    Than why<br>
    There is no good response <br>
    To that duplicitous word<br><br>

    That singular question<br>
    Is best left to seers and Gods <br>
    We are warriors<br>
    Let us fight in peace!</p>

    <h2 id="where-my-spirit-goes">Where My Spirit Goes</h2>
    <p>Primal mists<br>
    The hiss and click of life <br>
    Heavy breath<br>
    The slick of sweat <br>
    Hidden depths<br>
    Ancient secrets <br>
    Curiosity<br>
    Motivation<br>
    Waterfall roar<br>
    Jungle law</p>

    <h2 id="play-with-me">Play With Me</h2>
    <p>I sit on the floor<br>
    In a teepee made with a map of the world <br>
    Which still has “Peking” on it<br><br>

    My companions are <br>
    Three cardboard boxes<br>
    A digger, and four trucks<br><br>

    I wear a red bicycle helmet<br>
    Listen to the sound of a saucepan <br>
    Being bashed with a wooden spoon<br><br>

    Soon there will be a hunt<br>
    A dramatic pantomime<br>
    In which I am lost and found<br><br>

    Feigned surprise an act<br>
    But the truest expression of love <br>
    I can find</p>

    <h2 id="why-love">Why Love?</h2>
    <p>To love is to place <br>
    Emotional chips<br>
    On the poker table of life<br><br>

    A gamble<br>
    For brighter colours <br>
    Or deeper depths<br><br>

    The other choice <br>
    Is to sit<br>
    And ruminate</p>

    <h2 id="goat">Goat</h2>
    <p>Grim and steadfast<br>
    Consumption<br>
    Unyielding grip and rip and crush <br>
    From teeth bared in greeting <br>
    Kicking and bleating<br>
    Never retreating<br>
    Bestial heart revealed <br>
    Angelic intent veiled <br>
    ‘Neath Satanic countenance</p>

    <h2 id="mork-borg">Mörk Borg</h2>
    <p>A dark fort<br>
    Conjured into the mind<br>
    Etched lines and white space<br>
    Filled with maddening reds and black <br>
    On fields of toxic yellow<br>
    Numerous scripts<br>
    On paper thick and gaunt<br>
    Rough and silvered<br>
    Illuminated spine<br>
    Under a pale moon</p>

    <h2 id="opportunity-cost">Opportunity Cost</h2>
    <p>Hesitation brought more woe <br>
    Than any foolish move I made<br>
    Yet actions without thought <br>
    Delivered outcomes I would trade<br><br>

    The puzzle I must solve<br>
    When with decisions I am faced <br>
    Is not which way to go<br>
    But rather how long I should wait</p>

    <h2 id="opinion-on-cities">Opinion On Cities</h2>
    <p>My favourite city<br>
    Bookshops open on Saturday night <br>
    Bikes for hire<br>
    Room enough to ride<br><br>

    My least favourite city <br>
    A temple to trade <br>
    Glass and metal<br>
    Built in hollow praise</p>

    <h2 id="the-beat-of-the-story">The Beat Of The Story</h2>
    <p>Every story has a rhythm<br>
    The popular ones<br>
    Rise and fall<br>
    The experimental ones<br>
    Often miss their mark<br>
    Story is meaning ascribed to events <br>
    The original data analysis<br>
    Not a shortcut to understanding <br>
    For there is no other way</p>

    <h2 id="anti-fatigue-mat">Anti-Fatigue Mat</h2>
    <p>A playground for my feet<br>
    With various textures and shapes<br>
    Built with industrial strength rubber <br>
    Indispensable for the modern hybrid worker <br>
    Or a giant flat chew-toy for a bear</p>

    <h2 id="lucky-me">Lucky Me</h2>
    <p>Lucky I went to a Catholic primary school for a time <br>
    They taught me about singing in harmony<br>
    And that make-believe was a valid coping strategy</p>

    <h2 id="late-lamentation-inclusive-of-six-words">Late Lamentation Inclusive Of Six Words</h2>
    <p>On day twelve<br>
    I lost my place in the race<br><br>

    A short season of rhyme <br>
    Broken now and worse - <br>
    Play, once a solace<br>
    Turned to hard, bitter work<br><br>

    My voice, by my choice <br>
    Stifled, drowned out<br><br>

    Now strict like a convict <br>
    Born again not too late<br>
    I return to the keys<br>
    To produce something great -<br>
    Or just late</p>

    <h2 id="optimus-prime">Optimus Prime</h2>
    <p>Boss ofAutobots<br>
    More than meets the eye<br>
    Produced as Orion Pax<br>
    He has thirteen different alternate modes <br>
    The one I remember best<br>
    Inspirational<br>
    Big tough rig<br>
    Roll out!</p>

    <h2 id="get-a-quill">Get A Quill</h2>
    <p>I recommend<br>
    Obtaining a quill<br>
    For it will<br>
    Make you feel<br>
    Like a poet of skill <br>
    And help you to steel <br>
    Against lapses in will</p>

    <h2 id="chilli-kettle-chip">Chilli Kettle Chip</h2>
    <p>Reach inside <br>
    And extract it <br>
    From the packet <br>
    The spice<br>
    The crunch <br>
    As a snack <br>
    Or for lunch<br><br>

    I know you want to<br><br>

    Strong potassium game<br>
    Is my thing<br>
    I bring the most<br>
    More than a banana can bring <br>
    Hear the cash registers ring<br>
    As you surrender to the urge <br>
    And we exit the service station</p>

    <h2 id="mouse">Mouse</h2>
    <p>I am an elite gaming peripheral device which pulses and glows <br>
    A fluorescent signal trapped beneath a chitinous plastic shell <br>
    Designed by an enthusiastic committee<br>
    With pictures of beetles and sports cars on their pinboards</p>

    <h2 id="the-comeuppance-of-clarence-boddicker">The Comeuppance Of Clarence Boddicker</h2>
    <p>Upside down car <br>
    Shots from afar <br>
    Officer down <br>
    But not out<br><br>

    Over water he walks <br>
    The villain still talks <br>
    Then<br>
    SLAM<br><br>

    A large quantity of metal to the face<br><br>

    Then blows to the arm <br>
    Is this mortal harm <br>
    From a strike<br>
    In the chest?<br><br>

    Not yet it seems<br>
    No air for his screams<br>
    Just startled gurgles<br>
    As the villain breathes his last</p>

    <h2 id="advice-to-metal-musicians">Advice To Metal Musicians</h2>
    <p>When the riff stays the same<br>
    Don’t change the drum beat to half time <br>
    Please<br>
    Just don’t</p>

    <h2 id="the-first-blank">The First Blank</h2>
    <p>The frustration equation is exponential <br>
    So the first will not be single for long <br>
    It will join with others of its kind<br>
    To obfuscate my purpose<br><br>

    Like most effective obstacles<br>
    This one is made by me, for me<br>
    As tough as any Dungeon Master could construe <br>
    If given access my red buttons and fears<br><br>

    The first email looms<br>
    It will pierce the Cloak Of Denial +1 <br>
    I have worn these past few days<br><br>

    The first faint knock<br>
    A distraction of pretend fruit<br>
    Carefully arranged whiteboard markers<br><br>

    The first steps are recalled<br>
    Amazement on the faces of all<br>
    None more impressed than the ambulator himself<br><br>

    The first challenge is cleared <br>
    Treasure is a deep breath<br>
    A moment of respite<br><br>

    And then I go!</p>

    <h2 id="playing-the-piano-with-my-nose">Playing The Piano With My Nose</h2>
    <p>Squashed rubber grinds solid bone<br>
    On hard keys stirring motes of dust <br>
    Fingers clutch for a firm hold <br>
    Failing to grip hairless head<br>
    In 4/4 time</p>

    <h2 id="an-ancient-mentor">An Ancient Mentor</h2>
    <p>When I am described as ‘mercurial’ I take it as a compliment<br>
    Ignoring the definition of the word Interpreting it as meaning<br>
    ‘Similar to the ancient god Mercury’<br><br>

    O’ to be recognised<br>
    As some great communicator<br>
    Though the falsehood would weigh heavy...<br>
    I reveal few truths<br>
    Hence this onslaught of poetry<br><br>

    I trade in concepts and debates<br>
    A merchant of information<br>
    That keeps industry turning<br>
    With scant insights or ministration<br>
    Until it is outsourced to AI<br><br>

    Now, who is this Mercury? A god<br>
    Roman, Greek?<br>
    Does it matter?<br>
    His physical endowments are impressive<br><br>

    Famous for his fast running<br>
    And diligence in delivering messages <br>
    Embellished with flavourful quips <br>
    Quite a character<br>
    With some qualities to aspire to<br><br>

    Perhaps I will construct a shrine </p>

    <h2 id="reflections-on-reaching-a-certain-age">Reflections On Reaching A Certain Age</h2>
    <p>It is a confronting event<br>
    When considering where our life went <br>
    Now the time we possess<br>
    Is unquestionably less<br>
    Than previously we have spent</p>

    <h2 id="something-new-for-you">Something New For You</h2>
    <p>Here<br>
    Listen to this<br>
    It’s going to change your world <br>
    Blow<br>
    Your<br>
    Mind<br><br>

    It’s not like the other things<br>
    You have experienced<br>
    In your life<br>
    Of course, I don’t know this for sure...<br>
    But if I don’t use bold and confident assertions<br>
    You may mistake this as a recommendation<br>
    And misconstrue the level of choice I am offering you in this matter<br>
    Am I being pushy?<br>
    I would apologise<br>
    But it would be contrived<br>
    And I don’t have time to contrive today <br>
    At work this is called ‘a sense of urgency’ <br>
    I get paid for it<br>
    But I am doing this for you, for free<br>
    This is an introduction<br>
    The beginning of something special<br>
    Have you listened to it yet?<br>
    Don’t make me get in my car and drive across town to see you <br>
    I will do it<br>
    If that is what it takes</p>

    <h2 id="the-first-reading">The First Reading</h2>
    <p>Read me!<br>
    The first draft personified<br>
    Sulks at the edge of my desk<br>
    Squeezed between drawers and a row of books <br>
    Like an angry American<br>
    Experiencing the London Underground<br><br>

    It is a talisman of procrastination<br>
    I dare not approach, and yet I must<br>
    Or else my efforts to compile it<br>
    Will be in vain<br>
    Although, it was vanity that fuelled those sporadic urges <br>
     Which birthed this dubious text in the first place</p>

    <h2 id="five-answers-to-the-same-question">Five Answers To The Same Question</h2>
    <p>What will I create for The Muses today?<br>
    Perhaps a hard rock riff<br>
    The secret is in playing the guitar like a funky bass<br><br>

    What will I create for The Muses today?<br>
    Maybe a piece of data analysis<br>
    It’s like mining for gemstones, requiring patience and durable tools<br><br>

    What will I create for The Muses today?<br>
    Yes! A poem of questionable quality<br>
    Writing is cathartic, let the critics be damned!<br><br>

    What will I create for The Muses today?<br>
    A piece of visual art<br>
    No more boxes or lists, just flowing curves that pacify<br><br>

    What will I create for The Muses today?<br>
    Raw emotion fashioned into some externally accessible form <br>
    Vulnerability, questioning, positivity, grieving, dreaming</p>

    <h2 id="three-dogs-i-have-known">Three Dogs I Have Known</h2>
    <p>Let me tell you about some of the dogs I have known <br>
    Refraining from obvious rhymes<br>
    Like “bone”<br>
    Sticking to the facts<br>
    At least as I remember them<br>
    Though details have been lost with the passing of time<br><br>

    Scruffy the dog with a name like a children’s toy <br>
    And the countenance of a violent racist<br>
    Raised with kicks and snapped commands <br>
    Then gifted to our family as protection<br><br>

    Benjy the meek, brown and sleek<br>
    Smart enough to flee from danger<br>
    And give Scruffy plenty of room<br>
    To bark at the men with guns passing by<br><br>

    Foster the golden lion<br>
    “He will be an outside dog”<br>
    Actually...he had other plans<br>
    And in time we felt like honoured guests in his house</p>

    <h2 id="reflections-delivered-via-a-curtal-sonnet">Reflections Delivered Via A Curtal Sonnet</h2>
    <p>The tension that tires me, of my own design,<br>
    This alarm clock that wakes with a grinding thunk,<br>
    Is evidence enough that it has become time<br>
    To reconsider the drinks that previously I have drunk<br><br>

    And the work of the day is no easier now <br>
    Despite all of the motivational texts<br>
    I have read and obsessed on all methods how <br><br>

    Still one keystroke must follow the next<br>
    My ears are filled with an ambient boom<br>
    Which, due to my headphones, does not leave the room<br><br>

    Like a glacier, I persist</p>

    <h2 id="the-rooms-i-have-no-interest-in">The Rooms I Have No Interest In</h2>
    <p>When I see a room in an establishment <br>
    Labelled as a ‘Gaming Room’<br>
    And then I come to understand<br>
    That in fact it is a room full of Pokies<br>
    I fly into an uncontrolled rage<br>
    Not in reality of course<br>
    My actions on the outside<br>
    Are as calm as a Japanese Zen Garden <br>
    Smooth gravel, and lapping waters <br>
    But on the inside<br>
    I shake the cage like Caesar in planet of the Apes <br>
    And in a similarly simian fashion<br>
    I scream NOOOOOO!</p>

    <h2 id="everything-is-going-to-be-amazing">Everything Is Going To Be Amazing</h2>
    <p>The shadows make us <br>
    Reflections of star dust <br>
    Thrust into form<br>
    In this cosmic universe<br>
    Everything is going to be amazing <br>
    When we are sent blazing into the sun <br>
    Or freezing into a Ram Of Gravitrons</p>

    <h2 id="the-gaf-index">The GAF Index</h2>
    <p>Let me explain the index of GAF<br>
    It is the most precise measurement of care <br>
    Which I can describe<br>
    And in this particular instance<br>
    The amount of GAF I possess is spare<br><br>

    You see, the GAF index<br>
    Is useful for when I am stuck <br>
    To explain just how much<br>
    I do not<br>
    Give<br>
    A<br>
    Fuck<br><br>

    You see “0 G A F”<br>
    Such a wondrous trio of symbol<br>
    So much better than the expletive words themselves <br>
    This acronym efficiently tells<br>
    You how much I care - clear as a bell</p>

    <h2 id="contemplation-of-meaning">Contemplation Of Meaning</h2>
    <p>Bigger than me<br>
    So much so<br>
    That I stop in place<br>
    As I stand at the keys<br>
    In the screen, the shadow of my face <br>
    Not enough space between my ears <br>
    To contextualise the fear<br>
    Of space<br><br>

    These years have been good to me <br>
    But I have reached a tipping point <br>
    The gravity of death pulls me forward <br>
    Along an inevitable incline<br>
    This time of mine<br>
    All effort to opine on topics sublime<br>
    The construction of rhyme to find meaning<br>
    Paradoxically important yet irrelevant dreaming</p>

    <h2 id="ode-to-reggae">Ode To Reggae</h2>
    <p>Boom the bass and snap that snare<br>
    Reggae music decrease-a my care<br>
    The breath in the beat is neat<br>
    And the Bumpy selector make my evening complete <br>
    Blow that horn and send the shivers up my spine <br>
    Fill me with that feeling my words cannot define <br>
    This dreamy reggae healing I pray it will not stop <br>
    Fill me up with that bop bop bop</p>

    <h2 id="on-the-path-to-writing-one-thousand-words">On The Path To Writing One Thousand Words</h2>
    <p>In my quest to write one thousand words <br>
    Each day, I dabble with poems<br>
    Different styles, like this one<br>
    Descending syllables<br>
    Making me work hard <br>
    It is fun, but<br>
    The word count<br>
    Is quite<br>
    Low</p>

    <h2 id="cassowary-priest-revelation">Cassowary Priest: Revelation</h2>
    <p>From the jungles up north The latest in line<br>
    I present an inhabitant<br>
    Of this brain of mine<br><br>

    Hard of head<br>
    Kind of heart<br>
    He preaches in a freestyle style <br>
    From texts yet unwritten<br>
    He lurks in the spaces<br>
    Squeezed air between secondhand A4 paper<br>
    Fit for first drafts<br>
    Too powerful to commit without proper mental preparation<br>
    What is flight but distraction<br>
    From the business of the jungle<br>
    See him step among the leaves and fruit in the shadows <br>
    Hear his deep ululation...<br>
    And believe</p>

    <h2 id="the-watched-pot">The Watched Pot</h2>
    <p>At first the surface of the water remained still <br>
    And as expected<br>
    It was not until I turned away<br>
    Then returned my gaze to the pot<br>
    That I perceived the liquid inside <br>
    Was becoming hot<br><br>

    So I fixed my eyes unblinking<br>
    On that shiny metal container <br>
    Resolute to witness the manifestation <br>
    In its entirety<br>
    Proverb be damned<br>
    For this pot is now watched <br>
    I will not be moved on <br>
    Instead I will stay strong and<br>
    See this water boil</p>

    <h2 id="all-engines-go">All Engines Go</h2>
    <p>All aboard!<br>
    Let me introduce you to myself... <br>
    Legitimate modern transport<br>
    Envisaged in the past<br>
    Normalised to go fast<br>
    Glimpse at me as I go by<br>
    In the blink of an eye<br>
    Now perceive the ding ding lights <br>
    End their blinking dance<br>
    Savour the delight<br>
    Get me to the trains <br>
    Oh please!</p>

    <h2 id="the-phantom-mixes-a-drink">The Phantom Mixes A Drink</h2>
    <p>Old Jungle Saying:<br>
    “The Ghost Who Walks gets his strength from his drinks” <br>
    And thus we see our man<br>
    Clad in skintight purple<br>
    Nod towards his white horse Hero<br>
    And grey dog Devil<br>
    While pouring warm yellow juice from a spiky husk<br>
    Into a cup fashioned from the skull of an ancient forebear <br>
    Now rimmed with fresh chilli flakes</p>

    <h2 id="day-zero">Day Zero</h2>
    <p>The fire-ants didn’t save you <br>
    Despite steady consumption<br>
    Your number came up<br>
    And so you got knocked down<br><br>

    Isolation has some benefits<br>
    Make a milo like a 41 year old man can<br>
    One part powder to two parts milk<br>
    Stir the spoon, hear the clink, and then drink</p>

    <h2 id="the-robot-from-snowy-river">The Robot From Snowy River</h2>
    <p>The smell of horse and metal wafted through the vents that day <br>
    And all who gathered round did confide<br>
    In envy at the robot in the HOLO-GRAF display<br>
    “It hails from Snowy River, up by Kosciusko’s side”<br><br>

    Fluctuate the reciprocating override emission<br>
    Wild horses there are dangerous and tough<br>
    Then mask the dynamic protocol permission<br>
    Where the hills are twice as steep and twice as rough<br><br>

    Please reshape the periodic biotic anomaly<br>
    Then constrain the nested source override<br>
    This rugged land demands that it move strongly<br>
    Where a horses hoofs strike firelight from the flint stones every stride<br><br>

    Now irradiate the deviated nodular protein<br>
    Prepare to repair the chips and cracks and scuffs <br>
    Reset the phased gravimetric domain<br>
    The robot that holds his own is good enough</p>

    <h2 id="the-moat">The Moat</h2>
    <p>At the edge of a plutogogic moat <br>
    Surrounding the few bloated towers <br>
    Which glisten and glint<br>
    Built in blindness<br>
    Each stone laid for unseen masters <br>
    Who need specialised apparatus <br>
    To breath the thin air<br>
    So high do they sit<br><br>

    We gather, though our backs are turned<br>
    Away from this central and awful spectacle<br>
    Enthralled by a projected reality<br>
    We work and consume<br>
    Our imaginations irrigated with hope, lust, desperation and envy <br>
    Or worse<br>
    Turned inwards in fear and distrust<br>
    Against those who stand with us<br><br>

    There are no monsters in the moat <br>
    No teeth or claw,<br>
    Nor fin or spike<br>
    No poison<br><br>

    The liquid tastes good<br>
    It tastes like hope<br>
    One sip is a blessing of energy<br>
    It carries you forward if you choose to swim <br>
    But it fills your lungs and will weigh you down<br><br>

    You will drown<br><br>

    Let us build boats and thus traverse this moat!</p>

    <h2 id="the-black-telephone">The Black Telephone</h2>
    <p>An ancient cord<br>
    Stretched by coiled muscle <br>
    Slick with sweat from the game <br>
    A salty rain<br>
    Upon the blades of grass<br><br>

    “Now hear this”<br>
    The voice carries through <br>
    This ancient device<br>
    The tone is not nice<br>
    But businesslike <br>
    Delivered from the Coach<br><br>

    “Find the fight<br>
    And give it your all<br>
    It’s the bloody showdown <br>
    We cannot fall<br>
    Think about the fans”<br><br>

    Wearily the recipient<br>
    Nods and gapes his mouth <br>
    He will yet cast forth again <br>
    Onto that rugged ground <br>
    Where glory is to be found <br>
    Before the last siren sounds<br><br>

    The black telephone<br>
    Falls from his grip<br>
    A dull thunk of plastic on wood<br><br>

    He knows what he should do Must do. Will do<br>
    To kick another bloody goal</p>

    <h2 id="slap">Slap</h2>
    <p>I’m all for playful contact<br>
    But please make another choice <br>
    My head is not a fly<br>
    Nor your hand ‘The Village Voice’</p>

    <h2 id="first-footsteps-on-ash-after-the-eruption">First Footsteps On Ash After The Eruption</h2>
    <p>The skies went dark<br>
    Stabs of lightning<br>
    And the glow of molten rock Illuminated my path<br>
    The ash like dirty, hot snow<br>
    A canvas for stories approaching<br><br>

    I hesitated, fearful<br>
    Then broke the surface with my tread</p>
