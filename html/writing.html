        <h1>Willie McRae... Writing</h1>

        <p>Here is my official writer biography:</p>

        <blockquote> "Willie McRae is a South Australian writer with deep interests including jungles, volcanoes, chilli, Daleks, trucks, and roleplaying games. <br>
          He wrote his first short story at the age of eight - a work of science fiction called ‘The Alien From Yxzfexoshs.’ <br>
          Since then, he has produced and distributed an assortment of words, including a collection of short stories called 'Danger Dreams'."
